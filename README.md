## üåü Overview

MS2EX is an open-source server emulator for MapleStory 2, a retired Korean MMORPG.

The project aims to recreate the server infrastructure using Elixir, a functional programming language known for building scalable and fault-tolerant applications.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Concurrent Architecture**: Built on the Erlang VM (BEAM) for excellent handling of concurrent connections
- **Hot Code Reloading**: Update code without restarting the server
- **Fault Tolerance**: Isolated processes ensure crashes don't bring down the entire system
- **Scalable Design**: Easily scale horizontally across multiple nodes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) 1.17
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) (optional, but recommended)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download) - Required for game client metadata
- LuaJIT dependencies - Required to run Game Client scripts

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sgessa/ms2ex.git ms2ex-server
   cd ms2ex-server
   ```

2. **Install Elixir and Erlang**
   Follow the instructions on the [Elixir installation page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) to install Elixir and Erlang.

   If you are using `asdf` you can simply do:

   ```bash
   asdf plugin add elixir
   asdf plugin add erlang
   asdf install
   ```

3. **Install Lua dependencies**
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   apt install libluajit-5.1-dev

   # For OSX
   brew install luajit
   ```

4. **Set up PostgreSQL and Redis**

   **Option A:** Using Docker (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Download the dump.rdb file from GitHub Releases first
   # Place it in the priv/redis-data/ directory of the project

   # Start PostgreSQL and Redis with Docker Compose
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This automatically sets up both services with the correct configuration and mounts the metadata file for Redis.

   **Option B:** Manual Setup
   - Install and configure PostgreSQL and Redis manually
   - Set up game client metadata as described in the [Game Client Metadata](#-game-client-metadata) section below

5. **Install Elixir dependencies and set-up the database**
   ```bash
   mix setup
   ```

6. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   mix run --no-halt
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Game Client Metadata

MS2EX requires game client metadata to function properly.

This section explains how to set up the Redis server that stores this essential data.

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is to use our pre-built Redis dump:

#### Option A: Using Docker Compose (Easiest)

Simply download the metadata file and place it in the right location:

1. **Download the latest Redis dump**:
   - Go to our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sgessa/ms2ex/releases) page
   - Download the latest `dump.rdb` file
   - Place it in the `priv/redis-data/` directory of the project

2. **Start Redis with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   The compose file is configured to automatically mount the metadata file and also set up PostgreSQL.

#### Option B: Manual Redis Setup

1. **Download the latest Redis dump (rdb)**:
   - Go to our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sgessa/ms2ex/releases) page
   - Download the latest `dump.rdb` file

2. **Place the file in your Redis data directory**:
   - For standard Redis installs: `/var/lib/redis/dump.rdb` (Linux) or appropriate directory based on your installation
   - For local development: Place it where your Redis instance can access it
   - Alternatively, specify the file path in your Redis configuration

3. **Restart Redis** to load the dump file

### Metadata System Overview

For those interested in extending or modifying the metadata, here's how the system works:

1. **Source Data**: The original game client XML files contain crucial game data.

2. **Parsing & Organization**: [MapleServer2](https://github.com/AlanMorel/MapleServer2) (a C# emulator) parses these XML files and stores them in a structured format in their MySQL database.

3. **Redis Export**: [Ms2ex.File](https://github.com/sgessa/ms2ex-file) reads the organized data from a MySQL and exports it to Redis.

4. **Server Usage**: MS2EX server reads the metadata from Redis at runtime.

### Advanced Setup (For Metadata Development)

If you need to extend or modify the metadata:

1. **Set up MapleServer2 with MySQL**:
   - Follow the instructions in the MapleServer2 repository to parse client XML files into MySQL.
   - Ensure the MySQL database is properly seeded with game metadata.

2. **Use Ms2ex.File to export to Redis**:
   - Clone the [Ms2ex.File repository](https://github.com/sgessa/ms2ex-file)
   - Follow the instructions in its README to connect to your MySQL database
   - Run the export process to transfer data to your Redis instance

3. **Configure MS2EX to use Redis**:
   - Ensure your Redis connection settings in `config/dev.exs` point to the Redis instance containing the metadata

### Troubleshooting

If MS2EX fails to start or exhibits unexpected behavior, verify that:
- Redis is running and accessible
- MS2EX's Redis connection configuration is correct
- The metadata has been correctly loaded
- For Docker setup: Make sure the `priv/redis-data/dump.rdb` file exists
- For pre-built dumps: Ensure you're using a Redis version compatible with the dump format
